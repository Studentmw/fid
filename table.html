      <td> a Yamper, Pikachu, Joltik, or Electrike (Route 4) are all great choices for Electric-types for Grass Types since her Drednaw is double-weak to Grass-type attacks,
        so consider something like Pumpkaboo (Route 4) or Gossifleur (Route 3).</td>

        This mysterious Trainer became the Gym Leader of Stow-on-Side Gym at a very young age. He is known to be very shy and fearful around
        people which is why he wears a mask.  He never removes his mask in public.</td>
      <td>Level 34 to 36</td>
      <td>Allister’s ghost-types are weak against ghost- and dark-type Pokémon, but most of them have double typing, making it a bit harder
        to pick a compatible weakness for all of them. They all keep their ghost-type weakness, but using ghost-types also makes you
        susceptible to getting hit with super effective moves. Also remember that normal- and fighting-type moves will not deal any damage to
        Allister’s Pokémon, but normal-types also won’t receive damage from ghost-type moves.</td>

        <td>Level 36 to 38</td>
        <td>Fairy-types are weak against steel- and poison-types, but using those won’t work against Weezing and Mawile. Mawile’s fairy-type
          weaknesses are completely negated by its steel-typing, so just blast it with fire- and ground-type moves to get by. This gym is
          also fairly clearable just by using your starter Pokémon, if you’re leveled high enough.</td>

            She is also the only known Gym Leader to have ever defeated Raihan, who is said to be the strongest Gym Leader in the Galar League.
            At one point, she wanted her son Gordie to run the Gym as her successor. However, her son wanted to be a Rock-type user instead.
            This led to a battle that caused the whole town to split, with the two never speaking to each other again. Despite this, Melony somehow
            became the first member of Gordie's fan club.</td>
          <td>Level 40 to 42</td>
          <td>Melony’s team is weak against fighting-, fire-, rock-, and steel-type moves.
            The only Pokémon here that might give you some trouble is Lapras, since its water-typing might throw your fire-type Pokémon into
            a world of pain.</td>

            <td> Level 44 to 46</td>
            <td>Dark-types are weak against bug-, fairy-, and fighting-types, though some of the dual typing in Piers’ party will counter
              those. Bug-type will be four times as effective on Malamar, whereas Fairy-type moves won’t do as much damage to Scrafty.
              Bring a good variety of Pokémon if you want to clear the gym with ease.</td>

                 only person who has come close to beating him, having managed to knock out more of Leon's Pokémon than anyone else. He's
                 said to be strong enough to become a Champion if he moved to another region, but has refused to do so out of desire of
                 wanting to defeat Leon. He is often seen taking selfies on his Rotom Phone, a habit he initially picked up to remind him of
                 the pain of defeat, but one which eventually spread to other parts of his lifestyle.</td>
              <td> Level 46 to 48</td>
              <td>Weirdly enough, Raihan only uses two dragon-type Pokémon.
                Raihan’s dragon-types are weak against dragon-, fairy-, and ice-types, with a couple of exceptions.
                For Gigalith and Sandaconda, you can use water- and grass-types to knock them down.</td>
